    "   1. A way to solve it would be to enforce the addition of documents for the relevant state educational standards\n",
    "3. The system can be sentitive to the exact words used to descibe the career interests (e.g.: \"retail salesperson\" or \"truck driver\" vs \"Driver/sales worker\")\n",

    "   1. There for, one would have to parse several documents to extract such words\n",
